## Related Work

www.Grammarly.com  – Our project stands out from Grammarly because they focus on larger text inputs, however our product is specific to resumes and users won’t have to copy and paste changes – it is all altered within the file. 

https://www.ResumeBuilder.com/ – Our project stands out from Resume builder because rather than just simply building the resume for you based on user inputs, we are editing + providing feedback to already created resumes (we are not a resume builder, rather a resume editor) 


## Open Questions
- Look into Google Doc/ Word Doc suggestions 
- Look into how  Grammarly processes suggestions 
- How to upload documents w/ drag and drop
- Look into ChatGPT integration / other free alternatives

## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.


One successful thing about this week is that we finished our MVP for our project.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

Some of the challenges our group faced was trying ot figure out a solution towards the AWS cloud getObject functionality where we had to pivot to scrapping that idea for somehting else.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

We were able to finish all of our sprint tasks for this week and now the only task left is to deploy the website onto render.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

THe resources provided to use were used to biuld the framework of our project, we had to do other research in order to immplement the main functionality of our application.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 Since we are done, there aren't many user stories or features that we would consider at risk at this moment.

- We struggled a lot with trying to implement the machine learning implementation in order to get the user their suggestions on the frontend for action verbs.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 - We were able to finish most of the tasks in our sprint backlog, the one task that's persisting is again the machine learning module.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

They helped somewhat in terms of getting our feet off the ground with this project. We have had to do a lot of outside research in terms of implementing the machine leanring.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

Right now, considering that we mainly only have the suggestion feature left for this project, I don't think there are any user stories that are "at risk"

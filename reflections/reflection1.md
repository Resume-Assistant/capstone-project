## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 One successful thing from this week was that we were able to set up our AWS cloud and be able to store a users resume on there and be able to access it in our code.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 Some challenges that we faced while working this week was figuring out the best way to implement the NPL system to our webpage. It took a lot of trial and error as well as ending up replacing the npl we were going to use to a new one using TensorFlow. Another challenge was setting up the AWS cloud to properly store the resumes that people uploaded because we weren't able to access them at some point because of the permissons of the user inside the bucket we created.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 Yes, I am glad to say that we did end up finishing majoirty of our specific plans for the sprint. There were many tasks that were broad and so didn't entirely single out specific tasks for this sprint.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 THe resources provided was helpful; however, there was a lot more outside research involving the usage of the npl as well as with the AWS cloud.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 As of right now, there doesn't seem to be any user story that's at risk. We seem to be pretty on track to complete all of our user stories within the next 2 weeks, and I am very glad to say so.
